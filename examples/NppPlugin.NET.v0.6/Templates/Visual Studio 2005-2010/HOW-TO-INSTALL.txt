Copy all files (not changing the subfolder structure!) into following folder:

"My Documents\Visual Studio {VERSION}\"

The template is now visible for C# and VB.NET in the 'New project' dialog.

IMPORTANT: In VB.NET projects you have to clear the root namespace in the settings!

Tested with VS2005, VS2008 and VS2010.

That's all.
Enjoy.
